# DisplayProfileManager: Windows Tray App for Fast Display Profiles

A Windows system tray tool to manage and switch between display settings quickly. Save per-monitor resolutions, refresh rates, and DPI scaling. Switch profiles with a click or automatically on start. Supports themes, profile import/export, and easy multi-monitor configuration.

This project focuses on clarity and control. It aims to be dependable in daily use. It keeps settings local to your machine for privacy. It runs in the system tray so you can work without interrupting your desktop flow.

Why this tool
- Quick access: Change display settings without opening the main system settings.
- Per-monitor control: Assign different resolutions, refresh rates, and DPI scaling to each monitor.
- Persisted work: Save profiles so your preferred setup stays intact after logins or restarts.
- Convenience features: Auto-start, themes, and easy import/export of profiles.
- Safe and local: All profile data is stored on the device; no cloud needs unless you opt in for export.

Core features
- System tray presence: The app sits in the notification area for fast access.
- Per-monitor profiles: Create and save settings specific to each connected monitor.
- Resolution switching: Set exact horizontal and vertical resolutions per monitor.
- Refresh rate control: Pick a refresh rate that matches your monitor’s spec.
- DPI scaling per monitor: Adjust how content is scaled on each display.
- Auto-start: Start with Windows so your preferred setup is ready on login.
- Theme support: Light and dark themes for the tray icon and the app window.
- Import/export: Move profiles between devices or back them up safely.
- Multi-monitor support: Work across several screens with predictable layouts.

How it works
- The app runs in the system tray and presents a profile list.
- Each profile stores settings for every connected monitor.
- When you apply a profile, the app uses Windows display APIs to apply the saved values.
- Profiles can be organized, copied, renamed, or deleted as needed.
- Importing a profile file brings its data into the app. Export creates a portable file for sharing or backup.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A Windows PC with a supported .NET Framework runtime and multiple monitors if you plan to use multi-monitor profiles.
- Installation: Download the Windows installer from the releases page and run it. The installer guides you through the setup.
- First run: After installation, the app places an icon in the system tray. Open the configuration panel to create your first profile.
- Basic workflow: Create a profile, assign per-monitor settings, save, then click Apply to switch to that configuration.
- Auto-start option: Turn on auto-start if you want the app to launch on login.

Work with profiles
- Create a profile: Give the profile a name. For each connected monitor, set the desired resolution, refresh rate, and DPI scaling.
- Save: Profiles are stored locally on your machine. They survive restarts and logins.
- Apply: Switch to a profile with a single click. The app enforces the chosen settings immediately.
- Rename: Change the profile name anytime. It helps you keep a clear library.

Per-monitor configuration
- Monitor mapping: The app detects connected displays and lists them in a consistent order.
- Individual settings: Each monitor can have its own resolution, refresh rate, and DPI scaling value.
- Default fallback: If a profile lacks a setting for a monitor, the app uses the system default for that monitor.
- DPI awareness: DPI changes are applied in a way that keeps UI elements legible without distortion.
- Safe edits: Changes apply when you click Apply. You can revert if something looks off.

Import and export
- Import: Load a profile file created on another device. The app validates the structure and contents before merging.
- Export: Save a profile to a portable file. This makes it easy to transfer your setup to another PC.
- File format: Profiles are stored in a human-readable format that can be opened and inspected. You can edit safely if you know what you’re doing.

Auto-start and theming
- Auto-start: Enable auto-start so your preferred profile loads automatically when Windows starts.
- Themes: Choose between light and dark modes for the tray icon and any windows that appear. The theme adapts to your system or remains fixed to your choice.
- Visual clarity: Theme choices are designed to keep settings legible under various lighting conditions.

Multi-monitor scenarios
- Primary and secondary displays: You can set different roles for each monitor (for example, main work vs. media display).
- Size and density: Profiles respect the physical characteristics of each monitor, including pixel density and physical resolution.
- Alignment: Profiles can assume a consistent arrangement when you reconnect displays, reducing the need to reconfigure every time.

Keyboard and accessibility
- Keyboard access: Quick actions can be performed with a keyboard shortcut for common tasks like applying a profile or opening the configuration panel.
- Focus and navigation: The UI is built with accessible focus order, making it easier to use with assistive technologies.
- Clear labels: Each control has a clear label so it’s easy to understand what a setting does.

Data storage and security
- Local storage: All profiles are stored locally on your device.
- Backups: Import/export acts as a backup method. It’s safe to keep copies on external storage if you want.
- Privacy: No data is uploaded by the app unless you explicitly export to a file and share it.

Troubleshooting
- Profiles don’t apply: Check that the target monitor supports the requested resolution and refresh rate. Some older displays may have limits.
- DPI scaling looks odd: Verify that the DPI value matches the monitor’s capabilities. Reboot after applying a profile if scaling doesn’t take effect immediately.
- Monitor not detected: Ensure cables are securely connected and recognized by Windows. Try reconnecting one monitor at a time.
- Auto-start not working: Check Windows startup settings. The app should be listed and enabled. If not, reconfigure the installer to include the startup entry.
- Theme issues: If icons appear faint, switch themes and back to reset icon rendering.

Known issues and limitations
- Some legacy monitors have limited support for certain resolutions or refresh rates. Profiles may require adjustments.
- DPI scaling on certain laptops with high DPI screens can behave differently after wake from sleep. A quick re-apply often fixes it.
- If a monitor is hot-plugged while Windows is running, the app may need a profile re-apply to adjust to the new display topology.

Roadmap
- Enhanced validation: More checks to prevent misconfiguration when applying profiles.
- Scheduling: Ability to switch profiles automatically at times or events.
- Cloud sync (optional): Sync profiles across your devices with user consent.
- Advanced scripting: Expose common actions through a simple scripting interface.
- More theme options: Additional color palettes and icon sets.

- Import/export dialog for saving and loading profile files.

Usage patterns and practical tips
- Start with a simple baseline profile. Use it as a template for more advanced configurations.
- When adding a new monitor, create a profile that documents the recommended resolution and DPI for that display.
- Use the Preview feature (if available) to confirm how a profile will affect each monitor before applying it.
- Make a backup of your profiles periodically by exporting them to a known location.
- Consider naming conventions that reflect purpose, such as “Work-30inch-4K” or “Movie-1080p-60Hz”.

Compatibility notes
- The tool targets Windows environments with WPF-based UI.
- It relies on standard Windows APIs for display management. Functionality may vary on very old hardware.
- It is designed to be safe on most systems, with safeguards to prevent invalid settings from applying.

Documentation and help
- The project includes a detailed user guide within the docs directory.
- You can view the latest installer details on the releases page.
- For quick help, use the built-in help panel that explains each setting with examples.

Release notes
